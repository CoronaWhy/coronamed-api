TCGA dataset has more categories of smoking history, including never-smoker, smoker reformed more than 15 years, smoker reformed less than 15 years and current smoker.

C shows expression in healthy lungs of smoker and non-smoker.

Significantly, current smoker and former smoker showed differently remodelled AT2 cells (AT2-smoking and AT2-reformed, respectively).

B shows expression in normal lung tissues of never-smoker/non-smoker, reformed/former smoker and current smoker with lung adenocarcinoma.

In the TCGA dataset, we found a significant trend of ACE2 gene expression regulation associated with the smoking history that current smokers had the highest expression, non-smokers had the lowest expression and former smokers had that inbetween (ordinal regression p-value=0.01, Fig.

  A shows expression in normal lung tissues of smoker and non-smoker with lung adenocarcinoma.

Smokers in GSE10072 showed a higher mean of ACE2 gene expression than non-smokers.

Given that the GSE19804 microarray study focused on female nonsmokers while the GSE10072 dataset includes samples from both males and females and both smokers and non-smokers, we believe that the observed disparity may be due to other factors other than race, such as smoking, gender and unknown factors.",2020-03-27
