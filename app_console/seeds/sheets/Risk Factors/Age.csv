The predictor for disease severity included old age (≥ 50 yrs, odds ratio [OR] = 2.61; 95% CI, 2.29-2.98), male (OR =1.348, 95% CI, 1.195-1.521), smoking (OR =1.734, 95% CI, 1.146-2.626) and any comorbidity (OR = 2.635, 95% CI, 2.098-3.309), especially chronic kidney disease (CKD, OR = 6.017; 95% CI, 2.192-16.514), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, OR = 5.323; 95% CI, 2.613-10.847) and cerebrovascular disease (OR = 3.219; 95% CI, 1.486-6.972).

The pooled incidence of severity and mortality were 20.2% (95% CI, 15.1-25.2%) and 3.1% (95% CI, 1.9-4.2%), respectively.

Comorbidities with pooled OR larger than 2 included CKD (6.02; 95% CI, 2.19-16.51; n = 4; I 2 = 0), COPD (5.32; 95% CI, ; n = 6; I 2 = 0%), cerebrovascular diseases (3.19 ; 95% CI, 1.51-6.77; n = 6; I 2 = 0%), tumor (3.21; 95% CI, ; n = 4; I 2 = 30%), diabetes (2.49; 95% CI, ; n = 10; I 2 = 44%) and hypertension (2.06; 95% CI, 1.61-2.62; n = 10; I 2 = 36%) ( Figure 4 , eFigure 5).

Fever (79.1%; 95% CI, 68.0-90.3%), cough (58.0%; 95% CI, 42.0-74.0%) and fatigue (29.3%; 95% CI, 23.",2020-03-27
