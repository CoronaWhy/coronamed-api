Concerning respirators reuse, highly energetic short-wave ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) at 254 nm was proficiently applied to determine N95 respirators decontamination from viral respiratory agents, but it requires careful consideration of the type of respirator and of the biological target.

13 An experimental study conducted in 2015 confirmed 254 nm UVGI to be efficient in decontaminating N95 respirators from viral respiratory agents; the authors evaluated the effect of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation not only in terms of filtration performance, but also in terms of structural integrity.

The microwave oven irradiation and bleach decontamination methods were determined to be the least desirable among the 5 methods tested, due to excessive degradation of the respirators surface and to unpleasant odor respectively.

No visible changes were observed in any of the respirators after 3 or more treatment cycles with the UV-C room decontami-nation devices or with the UV-C box.

METHODS: A modification of the American Society for Testing and Materials standard quantitative carrier disk test method (ASTM E-2197-11) was used to examine the effectiveness of 3 methods, including ultraviolet-C (UV-C) light, a high-level disinfection cabinet that generates aerosolized peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide, and dry heat at 70°C for 30 minutes.

Figure 3 shows the efficacy of UV delivered by the room decontamination devices with two 15-minute cycles for the Moldex 1517 N95 respirator.

The respirators were placed inside a UV-C box (Advanced Ultraviolet Systems, South Hill, VA) that provides decontamination with 1 lamp below and 1 above the item to be decontaminated.

Dry heat at 70°C for 30 minutes was not effective for decontamination of the bacteriophages.

RESULTS: UV-C administered as a 1-minute cycle in a UV-C box or a 30-minute cycle by a room decontamination device reduced contamination but did not meet criteria for decontamination of the viruses from all sites on the N95s.

Efficacy of a multi-purpose high-level disinfection cabinet for decontamination of N95 respirators Efficacy of dry heat for decontamination of N95 respirators Dry heat at 70°C for 30 minutes had limited effectiveness against bacteriophages MS2 and Phi6 versus MRSA (<1 log 10 PFU versus >4 log 10 CFU respectively, F = 54.7, df = 2, P< 0.01).

The respirators were exposed to a 60-second cycle of UV-C inside a UV-C box.

For each UV-C experiment, a colorimetric indicator (UVC Dose Indicator, American Ultraviolet, Lebanon, IN) was placed adjacent to the respirator to provide a visual assessment of UV-C delivery to the respirator.

In general, greater reductions were achieved with the longer UV-C cycles using the low-pressure mercury room decontamination device in comparison to the short cycles in the UV-C box, and reductions on the interior surfaces and the exterior surface were comparable.
