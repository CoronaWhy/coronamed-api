If migration is sufficiently high and migrant genes are not selected against, gene flow will homogenize allele frequencies and reduce genetic differences in the genetic composition of populations.Genetic drift Genetic drift is the stochastic change in allele frequencies over generations.

In this way, the frequency of the ‘good’ gene variants will increase in the population, leading to evolutionary adaptation.Gene flow Gene flow is the exchange of genetic material between populations.",2020-04-10
