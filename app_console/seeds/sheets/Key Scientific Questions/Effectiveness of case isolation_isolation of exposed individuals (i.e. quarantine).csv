The model, which incorporates the main non-pharmaceutical interventions being implemented to curtail COVID-19 transmission in a community (such as social-distancing, quarantine of suspected cases, isolation of confirmed cases, contact-tracing, testing and use of face-masks in public), is formulated based on stratifying the total human population at time t, denoted by N (t), into the mutuallyexclusive compartments of non-quarantined susceptible (S u (t)), quarantined susceptible (S q (t)), non-quarantined exposed (i.e., newly-infected individuals who do not yet show symptoms of the disease and cannot transmit infection, E u (t)), quarantined exposed (E q (t)), symptomatically-infectious (I u (t)), asymptomatically-infectious (I a (t)), hospitalized/isolated (I h (t)), intensive care patients (I icu (t)) and recovered (R(t)), so that N (t) = S u (t) + S q (t) + E u (t) + E q (t) + I u (t) + I a (t) + I h (t) + I icu (t) + R(t).

The parameters σ u (σ q ) is the rate at which exposed non-quarantined (quarantined) individuals progress to the symptomatic (hospitalized) class (i.e., 1/σ u and 1/σ q is the intrinsic incubation period of non-quarantined and quarantined exposed individuals, respectively).

In the model (2.1), the parameter 0 < p ≤ 1 is the probability of infection per contact, while q is the proportion of non-quarantined individuals that are infected at the time of quarantine.

It should be mentioned that, in the formulation of the model (2.1), the quarantine rate is defined as a function of the proportion of infectious individuals in the community (in particular, the quarantine rate of susceptible individuals is (1 − p)λ, while that of newly-infected exposed individuals in the E q class is qpλ, where λ is the force of infection).

Quarantine and isolation can either be at home (self-quarantine and self-isolation) or at designated healthcare facilities.

Thus, the process of quarantining individuals suspected of having had close contacts with an infectious individual can be interpreted as contact-tracing.

The parameter ψ q measures the rate at which quarantined-susceptible individuals revert to the wholly-susceptible non-quarantined class (S u ) at the end of the quarantine period.
