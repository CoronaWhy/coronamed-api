All this has largely increased the probability of viral spillover from bats to humans and/or to intermediate hosts (wild or domesticated) with which bats come into contact, with global connectivity then amplifying its human to human transmission.

To the extent that humans transform and occupy the forest ecosystem (e.g., palm oil or tea plantations, livestock pastures), they disrupt the ecology of wild animals, which in turn may increase the likelihood of viruses finding their way into intermediate hosts (wild or domesticated) and eventually into humans.

These animals are sourced legally or illegally, from the wild or from wildlife farms.
