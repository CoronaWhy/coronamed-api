Background: Policymakers have employed various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as stay-at-home orders and school closures to limit the spread of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

found public venue closures to be the most effective NPI in reducing new cases, followed by public gathering bans, non-essential business closures, and international travel restrictions, with school closures decreasing case count minimally.

This study indicates that stay-at-home orders, limitations on mass gatherings, educational facility closures, and non-essential businesses closures are all effective measures at reducing transmission rates thereby flattening the curve.

A preprint modelling study 43 examined the effect of school closure together with other social distancing measures in Wuhan, China.

No data are available on the effectiveness of school closure as there was little variation in timing of closures (closures were reportedly applied in all Chinese cities uniformly and without delay) and school closures were part of a broad range of quarantine and social distancing measures.

School closures were implemented at the same time as a number of other stringent social distancing measures, with school closures extended initially to March, 2020, then to April, 2020.

31 An early modelling study of a SARS-like illness in school children concluded that a school closure policy would reduce the effective R by 12-41% depending on the proportion of between-household mixing that occurred during school hours.

More research is urgently needed on the effectiveness of school closures and other school social distancing practices to inform policies related to COVID-19.

Both of these studies concluded that the overall package of quarantine and social distancing was effective in reducing the epidemic in mainland China, 41, 42 although the relative contribution of school closures was not assessed.

1 Currently, the evidence to support national closure of schools to combat COVID-19 is very weak and data from influenza outbreaks suggest that school closures could have relatively small effects on a virus with COVID-19's high transmissibility and apparent low clinical effect on school children.

7 The economic harms of school closures are high.

Recent modelling studies of COVID-19 predict that school closures alone would prevent only 2–4% of deaths, much less than other social distancing interventions.

Other less disruptive social distancing interventions in schools require further consideration if restrictive social distancing policies are implemented for long periods.

They modelled a scenario in which all schools and 25% of universities were closed and where the effect on non-school social contacts was an increase of 50% in household contact rates for families with children and a 25% increase in community contacts during the closure.",2020-04-10

The modelled effects of intense control measures of prolonged school closure and work holidays vary by the duration of infectiousness.

Extreme social distancing measures, including school closures, workplace closures, and avoiding any public gatherings all at once, can push the transmission to households leading to increased clustering in .

We consider the following three scenarios: theoretical: assume no change to social mixing patterns at all location types, no school term break and no Lunar New Year holidays; no interventions, winter school break in Wuhan, and Lunar New Year holidays: assume no social distancing control measures, school-going individuals do not have any contacts at school because of school holidays from 15 th January-10 th February 2020 and 10% and later 75% of workforce will be working during the holidays from 25 th -31 st January 2020 and from 1 st -10 th February 2020, respectively; intense control measures in Wuhan to contain the outbreak: assume school closure and about 10% of workforce-for example, healthcare personnel, police, other essential government staff-will be working even during the control measures (Fig 2 and Fig S4) .
