High Temperature and High Humidity Reduce the Transmission of COVID-19

This paper investigates the influence of air temperature and relative humidity on the transmission of COVID-19.

However, up to now, there is no direct evidence on the influence of temperature and humidity on the transmission of the COVID-19.

Absolute humidity, the mass of water vapor per cubic meter of air, relates to both temperature and relative humidity.

Temperature and relative humidity have quite strong influences on R values, with 1% significant levels for both in Table 2 .",2020-05-01
