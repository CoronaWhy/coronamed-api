As a result, the 2018 mobility data we use are likely not as representative of inter-city human movement after travel restrictions were implemented in Wuhan.

As inter-city mobility was restricted after 23 January, we tested two altered travel scenarios: (i) scenario 1: a 98% reduction of travel in and out of Wuhan and an 80% reduction of travel between all other cities, as indicated by changes in the Baidu Mobility Index (table S2); and (ii) scenario 2: a complete stoppage of inter-city travel (i.e., θ to 0) (see supplementary methods for more details).

These control measures included: travel restrictions imposed between major cities and Wuhan; self-quarantine and contact precautions advocated by the government; and more available rapid testing for infection confirmation  .
