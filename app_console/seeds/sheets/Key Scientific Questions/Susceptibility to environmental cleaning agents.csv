In chlorine disinfection, the effective constituent is HClO.

The dosing system of chlorine dioxide for wastewater disinfection is consistent with the sodium hypochlorite disinfection technology, i.e.

And the mechanism of sodium hypochlorite disinfection is: NaClO+H2O=HOCl+NaOH

And the mechanism of sodium hypochlorite disinfection is:

Chlorine disinfection (liquid chlorine, chlorine dioxide, and sodium hypochlorite), which has long been used in hospital wastewater disinfection in China, is adopted in this scheme.

Generally, the crushed hospital wastes are mixed with chemical disinfectants (such as sodium hypochlorite, calcium hypochlorite, chlorine dioxide, etc.)

The mechanism of chlorine disinfection is:

The content of available chlorine in sodium hypochlorite is approximately 5%–20%.

The content of available chlorine in sodium hypochlorite is approximately 5%e20%.

They are suggested to be disinfected using solid or liquid chlorine containing disinfectants with available chlorine concentration of 20 g/L and disinfection duration of 2 h. Pharmaceutical wastes and chemical wastes are suggested to be incinerated.

 compared disinfection performance of different technologies and reported that chlorine and UV irradiation were the most efficient followed by chlorine dioxide, though efficiency of ozone disinfection was not ideal.

Moreover, chlorine disinfectants with 500 mg/L and 1,000 mg/L are suggested for disinfection of other protection products without or with obvious contamination, respectively.

Ozone, ultraviolet irradiation, liquid chlorine, chlorine dioxide, and sodium hypochlorite disinfections are commonly used technologies for hospital wastewater disinfection (Chen et al., 2014; Lizasoain et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2014) .

When using a chlorine dioxide generator, the content of chlorine dioxide must be higher than 50%, and it should ensure safe operation and automatic addition of disinfectants with certain proportion (Wang et al., 2013).

When using a chlorine dioxide generator, the content of chlorine dioxide must be higher than 50%, and it should ensure safe operation and automatic addition of disinfectants with certain proportion (Wang et al., 2013) .

All SARS viruses could be inactivated in 30 min at 20 °C with more than 0.5 mg/L residual free chlorine or 2.19 mg/L residual chlorine dioxide left (Chen et al., 2006).

All SARS viruses could be inactivated in 30 min at 20 C with more than 0.5 mg/L residual free chlorine or 2.19 mg/L residual chlorine dioxide left (Chen et al., 2006) .

It is generally recommended that the amount of chlorine dioxide used to treat hospital wastewater is 1/2.5 that of the available chlorine (NHC, 2002).

A double siphon automatic fixedratio dosing chlorine system is usually adopted for sodium hypochlorite disinfection.

The solubility of chlorine dioxide is five times that of chlorine and the oxidization capacity of chlorine dioxide is 2.63 times that of chlorine gas.

Chlorine is a kind of strong oxidizer, which is one of the most early used disinfection methods in disinfecting hospital wastewater (Yu-Mei et al., 2010) .",2020-05-12
