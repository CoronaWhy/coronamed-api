Because standard clinical RT-PCR testing is unlikely to meet rising test demand, there is a critical need for the development of alternative approaches for home-based point-of-care (POC) testing.

The potential rapid and easy-to-use paper-based LAMP assay for COVID-19 could be used in combination with a smartphone application to facilitate test results recording/sharing.

In this figure, the conceptual workflow of integrating both point-of-care diagnostic and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay with mobile device was presented.

For these reasons, an alternative, rapid, inexpensive, easy-to-use, and sensitive COVID-19 diagnostic tool must be developed for use by nonclinical individuals in their homes.

These approaches may include LAMP assay and lateral flow assay techniques.",2020-04-24

Also, the multiplexing of LFAs is a critical area for the development of the POC diagnostics.

Toward this end, the development of devices may be divided into three stages: 1) initiate research study to demonstrate the feasibility of integrating new detection techniques on LFA strips and the research outcomes could serve as a guideline to develop portable systems; 2) prototype a benchtop system consisting of lower-cost and smaller components, which offers on-demand tests and can be installed in hospitals or central referral laboratories; and 3) develop a handheld system that can be used in a wide range of environmental settings and fulfill the need of on-site decision making with high sensitivity.

For future POC diagnostics, the highly flexible formats of LFA allow further integration of novel materials and techniques.

To validate the analytical performance of benchtop device, commercially available LFA kits for three diseases (influenza A, malaria, and C. difficile) were used.

Using CrAg LFA kits as an example, PA method could significantly enhance the sensitivity over the colorimetric detection.",2020-04-17
