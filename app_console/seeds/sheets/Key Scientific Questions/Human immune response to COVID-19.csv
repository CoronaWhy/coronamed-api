These data therefore suggest that an exuberant innate immune response in the later part of the disease is the main immune dysregulation in patients with severe, but not mild, COVID-19 infection.

Innate immune responses are the first line of defense against invading pathogens.

Viral entry and cell infection trigger the host's immune response, and an inflammatory cascade is initiated by innate immune cells.

Trained immunity is defined as an enhanced innate immune response to different pathogens, after an initial challenge such a vaccination or infection.

Long-term boosting of innate immune responses, also termed ‘trained immunity’, by certain live vaccines (BCG, oral polio vaccine, measles) induces heterologous protection against infections, through epigenetic, transcriptional and functional reprogramming of innate immune cells.

For a long time, it was believed that only cells of the adaptive immune system can mount immunological memory, and protect against recurrent infections.

In patients with SARS, innate immune responses characterised by an extended period of cytokine secretion (eg, IFNα and IFNβ) was correlated with delayed antibody responses and poor management outcomes; this prolonged innate response has not yet been shown in patients infected with MERS-CoV.

MERS-CoV pathogenesis reflects a balance between coronavirus-induced protective and pathogenic host immune responses and direct cytotoxic effects of the virus.52 According to studies of patients infected with SARS-CoV and of mice and other animals infected experimentally with MERS-CoV, successful resolution of MERS and long-term protection from re-infection likely requires well coordinated innate and adaptive B-cell and T-cell responses.
