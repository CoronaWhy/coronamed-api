In the model (2.1), the parameter 0 < p â¤ 1 is the probability of infection per contact, while q is the proportion of non-quarantined individuals that are infected at the time of quarantine.

It should be mentioned that, in the formulation of the model (2.1), the quarantine rate is defined as a function of the proportion of infectious individuals in the community (in particular, the quarantine rate of susceptible individuals is (1 â p)Î», while that of newly-infected exposed individuals in the E q class is qpÎ», where Î» is the force of infection).

Quarantine and isolation can either be at home (self-quarantine and self-isolation) or at designated healthcare facilities.

Thus, the process of quarantining individuals suspected of having had close contacts with an infectious individual can be interpreted as contact-tracing.

The parameter Ï q measures the rate at which quarantined-susceptible individuals revert to the wholly-susceptible non-quarantined class (S u ) at the end of the quarantine period.

In chlorine disinfection, the effective constituent is HClO.

The dosing system of chlorine dioxide for wastewater disinfection is consistent with the sodium hypochlorite disinfection technology, i.e.

And the mechanism of sodium hypochlorite disinfection is: NaClO+H2O=HOCl+NaOH

And the mechanism of sodium hypochlorite disinfection is:

Chlorine disinfection (liquid chlorine, chlorine dioxide, and sodium hypochlorite), which has long been used in hospital wastewater disinfection in China, is adopted in this scheme.

Generally, the crushed hospital wastes are mixed with chemical disinfectants (such as sodium hypochlorite, calcium hypochlorite, chlorine dioxide, etc.)

The mechanism of chlorine disinfection is:

The content of available chlorine in sodium hypochlorite is approximately 5%â20%.

The content of available chlorine in sodium hypochlorite is approximately 5%e20%.

They are suggested to be disinfected using solid or liquid chlorine containing disinfectants with available chlorine concentration of 20 g/L and disinfection duration of 2 h. Pharmaceutical wastes and chemical wastes are suggested to be incinerated.

 compared disinfection performance of different technologies and reported that chlorine and UV irradiation were the most efficient followed by chlorine dioxide, though efficiency of ozone disinfection was not ideal.

Moreover, chlorine disinfectants with 500 mg/L and 1,000 mg/L are suggested for disinfection of other protection products without or with obvious contamination, respectively.

Ozone, ultraviolet irradiation, liquid chlorine, chlorine dioxide, and sodium hypochlorite disinfections are commonly used technologies for hospital wastewater disinfection (Chen et al., 2014; Lizasoain et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2014) .

When using a chlorine dioxide generator, the content of chlorine dioxide must be higher than 50%, and it should ensure safe operation and automatic addition of disinfectants with certain proportion (Wang et al., 2013).

When using a chlorine dioxide generator, the content of chlorine dioxide must be higher than 50%, and it should ensure safe operation and automatic addition of disinfectants with certain proportion (Wang et al., 2013) .

All SARS viruses could be inactivated in 30 min at 20 Â°C with more than 0.5 mg/L residual free chlorine or 2.19 mg/L residual chlorine dioxide left (Chen et al., 2006).

All SARS viruses could be inactivated in 30 min at 20 C with more than 0.5 mg/L residual free chlorine or 2.19 mg/L residual chlorine dioxide left (Chen et al., 2006) .

It is generally recommended that the amount of chlorine dioxide used to treat hospital wastewater is 1/2.5 that of the available chlorine (NHC, 2002).

A double siphon automatic fixedratio dosing chlorine system is usually adopted for sodium hypochlorite disinfection.

The solubility of chlorine dioxide is five times that of chlorine and the oxidization capacity of chlorine dioxide is 2.63 times that of chlorine gas.

Chlorine is a kind of strong oxidizer, which is one of the most early used disinfection methods in disinfecting hospital wastewater (Yu-Mei et al., 2010) .",2020-05-12

Concerning respirators reuse, highly energetic short-wave ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) at 254 nm was proficiently applied to determine N95 respirators decontamination from viral respiratory agents, but it requires careful consideration of the type of respirator and of the biological target.

13 An experimental study conducted in 2015 confirmed 254 nm UVGI to be efficient in decontaminating N95 respirators from viral respiratory agents; the authors evaluated the effect of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation not only in terms of filtration performance, but also in terms of structural integrity.

The microwave oven irradiation and bleach decontamination methods were determined to be the least desirable among the 5 methods tested, due to excessive degradation of the respirators surface and to unpleasant odor respectively.

No visible changes were observed in any of the respirators after 3 or more treatment cycles with the UV-C room decontami-nation devices or with the UV-C box.

METHODS: A modification of the American Society for Testing and Materials standard quantitative carrier disk test method (ASTM E-2197-11) was used to examine the effectiveness of 3 methods, including ultraviolet-C (UV-C) light, a high-level disinfection cabinet that generates aerosolized peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide, and dry heat at 70Â°C for 30 minutes.

Because standard clinical RT-PCR testing is unlikely to meet rising test demand, there is a critical need for the development of alternative approaches for home-based point-of-care (POC) testing.

The potential rapid and easy-to-use paper-based LAMP assay for COVID-19 could be used in combination with a smartphone application to facilitate test results recording/sharing.

In this figure, the conceptual workflow of integrating both point-of-care diagnostic and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay with mobile device was presented.

These data therefore suggest that an exuberant innate immune response in the later part of the disease is the main immune dysregulation in patients with severe, but not mild, COVID-19 infection.

Innate immune responses are the first line of defense against invading pathogens.

Viral entry and cell infection trigger the host's immune response, and an inflammatory cascade is initiated by innate immune cells.

Trained immunity is defined as an enhanced innate immune response to different pathogens, after an initial challenge such a vaccination or infection.

Long-term boosting of innate immune responses, also termed âtrained immunityâ, by certain live vaccines (BCG, oral polio vaccine, measles) induces heterologous protection against infections, through epigenetic, transcriptional and functional reprogramming of innate immune cells.

There are currently no data on the specific role of either humoral or cellular immunity or innate immunity in patients recovering from COVID-19.

While the virus elicits an immune response leading to elimination of infected cells (and hence clearance of the infection), it tends to suppress the immune response.

Animal models suggest that the efficiency of T lymphocyte-mediated immune responses is pivotal for controlling MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infections .",2020-04-17

A preprint modelling study 43 examined the effect of school closure together with other social distancing measures in Wuhan, China.

No data are available on the effectiveness of school closure as there was little variation in timing of closures (closures were reportedly applied in all Chinese cities uniformly and without delay) and school closures were part of a broad range of quarantine and social distancing measures.

School closures were implemented at the same time as a number of other stringent social distancing measures, with school closures extended initially to March, 2020, then to April, 2020.

31 An early modelling study of a SARS-like illness in school children concluded that a school closure policy would reduce the effective R by 12-41% depending on the proportion of between-household mixing that occurred during school hours.

More research is urgently needed on the effectiveness of school closures and other school social distancing practices to inform policies related to COVID-19.

Both of these studies concluded that the overall package of quarantine and social distancing was effective in reducing the epidemic in mainland China, 41, 42 although the relative contribution of school closures was not assessed.

1 Currently, the evidence to support national closure of schools to combat COVID-19 is very weak and data from influenza outbreaks suggest that school closures could have relatively small effects on a virus with COVID-19's high transmissibility and apparent low clinical effect on school children.

7 The economic harms of school closures are high.

Recent modelling studies of COVID-19 predict that school closures alone would prevent only 2â4% of deaths, much less than other social distancing interventions.

Other less disruptive social distancing interventions in schools require further consideration if restrictive social distancing policies are implemented for long periods.

They modelled a scenario in which all schools and 25% of universities were closed and where the effect on non-school social contacts was an increase of 50% in household contact rates for families with children and a 25% increase in community contacts during the closure.",2020-04-10

The upper limit of latent period was defined as the interval between the exposure of infector and that of infectee in a transmission chain, which was used to estimate the longest possible latent period of an individual infector (the exact latent period cannot be observed in reality).

Specifically, it was aimed to obtain robust estimates of the following epidemiological parameters of COVID-19: 1) incubation period, 2) the upper limit of latent period, as the exact latent period cannot be observed, 3) serial interval, 4) time point of exposure, referring to the day of infectee's exposure to infector relative to the latter's symptom onset date, and 5) R0.
