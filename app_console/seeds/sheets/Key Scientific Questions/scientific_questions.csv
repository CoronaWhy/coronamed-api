In the model (2.1), the parameter 0 < p ≤ 1 is the probability of infection per contact, while q is the proportion of non-quarantined individuals that are infected at the time of quarantine.

It should be mentioned that, in the formulation of the model (2.1), the quarantine rate is defined as a function of the proportion of infectious individuals in the community (in particular, the quarantine rate of susceptible individuals is (1 − p)λ, while that of newly-infected exposed individuals in the E q class is qpλ, where λ is the force of infection).

Quarantine and isolation can either be at home (self-quarantine and self-isolation) or at designated healthcare facilities.

In chlorine disinfection, the effective constituent is HClO.

The dosing system of chlorine dioxide for wastewater disinfection is consistent with the sodium hypochlorite disinfection technology, i.e.

And the mechanism of sodium hypochlorite disinfection is: NaClO+H2O=HOCl+NaOH

And the mechanism of sodium hypochlorite disinfection is:

Chlorine disinfection (liquid chlorine, chlorine dioxide, and sodium hypochlorite), which has long been used in hospital wastewater disinfection in China, is adopted in this scheme.

Generally, the crushed hospital wastes are mixed with chemical disinfectants (such as sodium hypochlorite, calcium hypochlorite, chlorine dioxide, etc.)

The mechanism of chlorine disinfection is:

The content of available chlorine in sodium hypochlorite is approximately 5%–20%.

The content of available chlorine in sodium hypochlorite is approximately 5%e20%.

They are suggested to be disinfected using solid or liquid chlorine containing disinfectants with available chlorine concentration of 20 g/L and disinfection duration of 2 h. Pharmaceutical wastes and chemical wastes are suggested to be incinerated.

 compared disinfection performance of different technologies and reported that chlorine and UV irradiation were the most efficient followed by chlorine dioxide, though efficiency of ozone disinfection was not ideal.

Moreover, chlorine disinfectants with 500 mg/L and 1,000 mg/L are suggested for disinfection of other protection products without or with obvious contamination, respectively.

Ozone, ultraviolet irradiation, liquid chlorine, chlorine dioxide, and sodium hypochlorite disinfections are commonly used technologies for hospital wastewater disinfection (Chen et al., 2014; Lizasoain et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2014) .

When using a chlorine dioxide generator, the content of chlorine dioxide must be higher than 50%, and it should ensure safe operation and automatic addition of disinfectants with certain proportion (Wang et al., 2013).

When using a chlorine dioxide generator, the content of chlorine dioxide must be higher than 50%, and it should ensure safe operation and automatic addition of disinfectants with certain proportion (Wang et al., 2013) .

All SARS viruses could be inactivated in 30 min at 20 °C with more than 0.5 mg/L residual free chlorine or 2.19 mg/L residual chlorine dioxide left (Chen et al., 2006).

All SARS viruses could be inactivated in 30 min at 20 C with more than 0.5 mg/L residual free chlorine or 2.19 mg/L residual chlorine dioxide left (Chen et al., 2006) .

It is generally recommended that the amount of chlorine dioxide used to treat hospital wastewater is 1/2.5 that of the available chlorine (NHC, 2002).

A double siphon automatic fixedratio dosing chlorine system is usually adopted for sodium hypochlorite disinfection.

The solubility of chlorine dioxide is five times that of chlorine and the oxidization capacity of chlorine dioxide is 2.63 times that of chlorine gas.

Chlorine is a kind of strong oxidizer, which is one of the most early used disinfection methods in disinfecting hospital wastewater (Yu-Mei et al., 2010) .",2020-05-12

Concerning respirators reuse, highly energetic short-wave ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) at 254 nm was proficiently applied to determine N95 respirators decontamination from viral respiratory agents, but it requires careful consideration of the type of respirator and of the biological target.

13 An experimental study conducted in 2015 confirmed 254 nm UVGI to be efficient in decontaminating N95 respirators from viral respiratory agents; the authors evaluated the effect of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation not only in terms of filtration performance, but also in terms of structural integrity.

The microwave oven irradiation and bleach decontamination methods were determined to be the least desirable among the 5 methods tested, due to excessive degradation of the respirators surface and to unpleasant odor respectively.

A variety of strategies for decontamination of PPE are under investigation, including use of ultraviolet light and hydrogen peroxide vapor.

Notably, the short cycle of steam treatment was substantially more effective than ultraviolet light treatment for N95 decontamination and nearly as effective as aerosolized peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide.

Dry heat at the same temperature levels was much less effective, consistent with previous evidence that moist heat or microwave-generated steam is more effective than dry 2 heat for inactivation of viruses.

Investigations of moist heat are also needed as 20 minutes of exposure to moist heat at 65°C has been reported to be effective with minimal adverse effects on respirator performance.

No visible changes were observed in any of the respirators after 3 or more treatment cycles with the UV-C room decontami-nation devices or with the UV-C box.

METHODS: A modification of the American Society for Testing and Materials standard quantitative carrier disk test method (ASTM E-2197-11) was used to examine the effectiveness of 3 methods, including ultraviolet-C (UV-C) light, a high-level disinfection cabinet that generates aerosolized peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide, and dry heat at 70°C for 30 minutes.

Figure 3 shows the efficacy of UV delivered by the room decontamination devices with two 15-minute cycles for the Moldex 1517 N95 respirator.

The respirators were placed inside a UV-C box (Advanced Ultraviolet Systems, South Hill, VA) that provides decontamination with 1 lamp below and 1 above the item to be decontaminated.

Dry heat at 70°C for 30 minutes was not effective for decontamination of the bacteriophages.

RESULTS: UV-C administered as a 1-minute cycle in a UV-C box or a 30-minute cycle by a room decontamination device reduced contamination but did not meet criteria for decontamination of the viruses from all sites on the N95s.

The respirators were exposed to a 60-second cycle of UV-C inside a UV-C box.

For each UV-C experiment, a colorimetric indicator (UVC Dose Indicator, American Ultraviolet, Lebanon, IN) was placed adjacent to the respirator to provide a visual assessment of UV-C delivery to the respirator.

In general, greater reductions were achieved with the longer UV-C cycles using the low-pressure mercury room decontamination device in comparison to the short cycles in the UV-C box, and reductions on the interior surfaces and the exterior surface were comparable.

Because standard clinical RT-PCR testing is unlikely to meet rising test demand, there is a critical need for the development of alternative approaches for home-based point-of-care (POC) testing.

The potential rapid and easy-to-use paper-based LAMP assay for COVID-19 could be used in combination with a smartphone application to facilitate test results recording/sharing.

In this figure, the conceptual workflow of integrating both point-of-care diagnostic and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay with mobile device was presented.

Also, the multiplexing of LFAs is a critical area for the development of the POC diagnostics.

Toward this end, the development of devices may be divided into three stages: 1) initiate research study to demonstrate the feasibility of integrating new detection techniques on LFA strips and the research outcomes could serve as a guideline to develop portable systems; 2) prototype a benchtop system consisting of lower-cost and smaller components, which offers on-demand tests and can be installed in hospitals or central referral laboratories; and 3) develop a handheld system that can be used in a wide range of environmental settings and fulfill the need of on-site decision making with high sensitivity.

For future POC diagnostics, the highly flexible formats of LFA allow further integration of novel materials and techniques.

These data therefore suggest that an exuberant innate immune response in the later part of the disease is the main immune dysregulation in patients with severe, but not mild, COVID-19 infection.

Innate immune responses are the first line of defense against invading pathogens.

Viral entry and cell infection trigger the host's immune response, and an inflammatory cascade is initiated by innate immune cells.

Trained immunity is defined as an enhanced innate immune response to different pathogens, after an initial challenge such a vaccination or infection.

Long-term boosting of innate immune responses, also termed ‘trained immunity’, by certain live vaccines (BCG, oral polio vaccine, measles) induces heterologous protection against infections, through epigenetic, transcriptional and functional reprogramming of innate immune cells.

For a long time, it was believed that only cells of the adaptive immune system can mount immunological memory, and protect against recurrent infections.

A preprint modelling study 43 examined the effect of school closure together with other social distancing measures in Wuhan, China.

No data are available on the effectiveness of school closure as there was little variation in timing of closures (closures were reportedly applied in all Chinese cities uniformly and without delay) and school closures were part of a broad range of quarantine and social distancing measures.

School closures were implemented at the same time as a number of other stringent social distancing measures, with school closures extended initially to March, 2020, then to April, 2020.

31 An early modelling study of a SARS-like illness in school children concluded that a school closure policy would reduce the effective R by 12-41% depending on the proportion of between-household mixing that occurred during school hours.

More research is urgently needed on the effectiveness of school closures and other school social distancing practices to inform policies related to COVID-19.

Both of these studies concluded that the overall package of quarantine and social distancing was effective in reducing the epidemic in mainland China, 41, 42 although the relative contribution of school closures was not assessed.

1 Currently, the evidence to support national closure of schools to combat COVID-19 is very weak and data from influenza outbreaks suggest that school closures could have relatively small effects on a virus with COVID-19's high transmissibility and apparent low clinical effect on school children.

7 The economic harms of school closures are high.

Recent modelling studies of COVID-19 predict that school closures alone would prevent only 2–4% of deaths, much less than other social distancing interventions.

Other less disruptive social distancing interventions in schools require further consideration if restrictive social distancing policies are implemented for long periods.

They modelled a scenario in which all schools and 25% of universities were closed and where the effect on non-school social contacts was an increase of 50% in household contact rates for families with children and a 25% increase in community contacts during the closure.",2020-04-10

Asymptomatic infectees were excluded from the overall analysis of incubation period and serial interval, while asymptomatic infectors were excluded from the overall analysis of serial interval and time point of exposure.

This study aimed to obtain robust estimates of the incubation period, upper limit of latent period (interval between exposure of infector and infectee), serial interval, time point of exposure and basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19.

It was smaller than 0 (mean: −2.63 days) for 27 (3.92%) pairs, meaning that the infectee showed symptoms earlier than the infector.

Only 11 pairs of infector-infectee was eligible for estimation of the upper limit of latent period, which ranged from 0 to 5 days (Table 2 ) with a median of 1 day.

Serial interval was defined as the duration between symptom onset of an infector (e.g., a primary case) and that of an infectee (e.g., a secondary case) in a transmission chain, which was typically seen in cluster infections.

The upper limit of latent period was defined as the interval between the exposure of infector and that of infectee in a transmission chain, which was used to estimate the longest possible latent period of an individual infector (the exact latent period cannot be observed in reality).

Specifically, it was aimed to obtain robust estimates of the following epidemiological parameters of COVID-19: 1) incubation period, 2) the upper limit of latent period, as the exact latent period cannot be observed, 3) serial interval, 4) time point of exposure, referring to the day of infectee's exposure to infector relative to the latter's symptom onset date, and 5) R0.

If there were more than one infectee caused by an infector, only the one with the earliest exposure date was used in estimating this parameter.

Our analysis shows that: all mobility patterns correlated with the spread of the coronavirus in Chinese cities outside Hubei, while the corrleations droppd with the implemetation of travel restrictions; the cumulative confirmed cases in two weeks after the Wuhan lockdown was mainly brought by three patterns of inter-city population movement, while those in the third and fourth weeks after was significantly influenced by the number of intra-city population movement; the local travel restrictions imposed by cities outside Hubei have averted 1,960 (95%PI: 1,474-2,447) more infections, taking 22.4% (95%PI: 16.8%-27.9%) of confirmed ones, in two weeks after the Wuhan lockdown, while more synchronized implementation would further decrease the number of confirmed cases in the same period by 15.7% (95%PI:15.4%-16.0%) or 1,378 (95%PI: 1,353-1,402) cases; and local travel restrictions on different mobility patterns have different degrees of protection on cities with or without initial confirmed cases until the Wuhan lockdown.

In this scenario, the principle effect of school and workplace closures is in delaying the peak, buying more time for preparations (Fig 4G) .",2020-05-12

Findings The application of all four social distancing interventions: school closure, workplace non-attendance, increased case isolation, and community contact reduction is highly effective in flattening the epidemic curve, reducing the maximum daily case numbers, and lengthening outbreak duration.

These scenarios included isolation measures for infected individuals and quarantining of family members (hereafter referred to as quarantine); quarantine plus school closure; quarantine plus workplace distancing; and quarantine, school closure, and workplace distancing (hereafter referred to as the combined intervention).

Interpretation Implementing the combined intervention of quarantining infected individuals and their family members, workplace distancing, and school closure once community transmission has been detected could substantially reduce the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections.
