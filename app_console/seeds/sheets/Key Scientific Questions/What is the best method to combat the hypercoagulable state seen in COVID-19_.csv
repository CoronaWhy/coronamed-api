In case LMWH is insufcient of preventing further activation of PIC and the thromboses extend to pulmonary veins, The treatment option at this step should be Tissue Plasminogen Activator (TPA) or defbrotide.

The use of continuous postoperative systemic heparin infusion was significantly associated with survival.,"The clinical status was defined using the Rutherford classification system. The medical comorbidity grade and operative outcomes were defined in accordance with the recommended reporting standards and best practice documents from the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) and European Society for Vascular Surgery. Complications were recorded as perioperative (<30 days) or late (>1 month) and classified as graft-related or procedurerelated. The complications were described as mild (spontaneous resolution or with nominal intervention, did not prolong the hospital stay, and/or did not cause permanent disability), moderate (required significant intervention, prolonged hospitalization for >24 hours, resulted in a minor amputation, or was associated with a minor disability that did not interfere with normal daily activities), or severe (necessitated a major surgical, medical, and/or endovascular intervention or resulted in prolonged convalescence, major amputation, permanent disability, or death). Major amputations were classified as transfemoral or transtibial. Minor amputations were any toe or forefoot amputation and were not considered in the analysis of freedom from amputation. Successful revascularization of the treated segment was defined as the absence of early (<30 days) reocclusion or persistent forefoot ischemia or major amputation or death within 24 hours. The primary outcomes were successful revascularization, early (<30 days) and late survival, postoperative (<30 days) complications, and limb salvage at the last clinical evaluation available at least 7 days after revascularization.",Y,5/12/2020
2,2020-04-24,COVID-19 Coagulopathy in Caucasian patients,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjh.16749,British Journal of Haematology,Prospective observational study,Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH),83,Severe,Severe COVID-19 infection associated with significant coagulopathy that correlates with disease severity. However Caucasian COVID-19 patients on LMWH thrombo-prophylaxis rarely develop overt DIC.,"Coagulation testing performed on admission in the total cohort demonstrated normal PT and APTT (Table 1). In contrast, plasma D-dimer levels were significantly increased (median 732; range 200 to 10,000 ng/ml). D-dimer levels were above the normal range in 67% of the total cohort on admission. Importantly however, despite the increased D-dimers, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) was not evident. In particular, platelet counts were within the normal range in 83.1% with a platelet count <100 x 109/L observed in only 5 patients on admission. Fibrinogen levels were significantly increased (median 4.7; range 3.0 to 9.9 g/L) on admission, with levels remaining persistently elevated throughout hospitalisation. No patient had a fibrinogen level < 2.0 g/L at any time point. This increase in fibrinogen levels is probably due to an acute phase response, as significantly elevated C-reactive protein levels (median 56 mg/L; normal range 0-5 mg/L) were also observed. Thus, despite the fact that thrombotic risk is much higher in Caucasian patients and the significant elevated levels of D-dimers observed, overt DIC as defined according to the ISTH SSC DIC score16 was present in none of our COVID-19 patients at time of admission. Nevertheless, our data confirm that severe COVID-19 infection is associated with a significant coagulopathy in Caucasian patients that appears to be similar in magnitude to that previously reported in the original Chinese cohorts.

VTE included pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis  (DVT) diagnosed by accepted imaging tests. During the period considered for the present analysis, no VTE screening strategy among COVID-19 patients was in place at the study site: VTE imaging tests were performed in subjects with signs or symptoms of DVT or with an unexplained clinical worsening of the respiratory function, primarily assessed using the PaO2/FIO2 ratio, or a rapid increase of D-dimer levels. Two-point compression ultrasonography (CUS) was used on the intensive care unit (ICU); whole-leg ultrasound was performed in symptomatic patients on the general ward. Cardiovascular events included acute coronary syndrome/myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke, as reported by the treating physicians in the medical charts. Secondary outcome was overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). We reviewed the electronic medical charts and patients´ laboratory findings (platelet count, D-dimer, prothrombin time, fibrinogen level) of all COVID-19 patients to retrospectively calculate the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) score for overt DIC, which was considered present if the score was 5 or greater.",-,5/12/2020
